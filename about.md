First of all, thanks for reading. I'm happy you've landed on my site and even happier you want to know a little more about me.

I'm a senior software engineer, writer, occasional speaker, and valued community member. I focus on C#, .NET, and Azure.  I work in the insurance/financial services industry, helping development teams at my company work with Azure.

My community work has earned me the [Microsoft MVP award](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5004131?fullName=Dave%20Brock). I don't consider myself a high and mighty expert in anything, but someone who never stops learning and is passionate about sharing it.

My community work centers around the following:

- Regular posts on this site (*daveabrock.com*)
- A weekly .NET newsletter, [*The .NET Stacks*](https://dotnetstacks.com), where I write about trends, interview community leaders and show off what's new
- Contributions to the ASP.NET Core docs, [like this one](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/blazor/components/css-isolation?view=aspnetcore-5.0) and to other projects both big and small
- A few talks on various subjects, like C# and ASP.NET Core
- Technical reviewer for a book or two
- General Twitter tomfoolery

Please reach out! I would love to hear from you. Twitter is usually the best wayâ€”my DMs are open, even if you don't follow me.
