# ðŸ¥³.NET 5 is really here

Well, we made it: .NET 5 is [officially here](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-5-0). This week, Microsoft showed off their hard work during three busy days of .NET Confâ€”and with it, some [swag](https://www.dotnetconf.net/swag) including my new [default Visual Studio Code theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dotnetconfteam.dotnet-purple-theme). I'm starting to wonder if overhyping Blazor is possibleâ€”as great as it is, I wish Microsoft would dial it back a bit.

Anyway: we've spent the better part of six months discussing all the updates (like, [my favorite things](https://daveabrock.com/2020/11/13/dotnet-stacks-25), [Blazor's readiness](https://daveabrock.com/2020/11/06/dotnet-stacks-24), [the support model](https://daveabrock.com/2020/10/31/dotnet-stacks-23), [what's happening to .NET Standard](https://daveabrock.com/2020/09/26/dotnet-stacks-18), [EF Core 5](https://daveabrock.com/2020/09/19/dotnet-stacks-17), [app trimming](https://daveabrock.com/2020/09/12/dotnet-stacks-16), [System.Text.Json vs. Newtonsoft](https://daveabrock.com/2020/08/08/dotnet-stacks-11), and so much more).

As you can imagine, this week was light on news. As such, I know you're here for the .NET Conf linksâ€”so let me be of service.

From the Microsoft perspective, we had the following sessions:

* The Scotts [welcome you to .NET 5](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-esVzL3YLI).
* Mads Torgersen and Dustin Campbell [talk about C# 9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3kWzPKoRXc).
* Immo Landwerth and Phillip Carter [port projects to .NET 5](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvmd2F11jpA).
* James Newton-King [discusses high performance with gRPC](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ8M2Em5Zzc).
* Steve Sanderson and Safia Abdalla [talk about Blazor in .NET 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nag6u5TxjIA), and Daniel Roth and Javier Calvarro talk about [integrating it with ASP.NET Core](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEjqhTGrqDY).
* Rich Lander, Jan Kotas, and Stephen Toub [dive deep on the .NET 5 runtime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXJnop1bZ0).
* Scott Hanselman [updates his site to .NET 5, live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28D_roo3cUw).
* Chris Sfanos and Dmitry Lyalin [provide a .NET desktop development update](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDYcq1yKhiA).
* Claire Novotny and Layla Porter [provide a .NET Foundation update](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIBnjAdgik).
* Maddy Leger and David Ortinau [roll out Xamarin.Forms 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7UVz82dE90).

From the community, so many great sessions (hit this link for everything), but these were some of my favorites...
