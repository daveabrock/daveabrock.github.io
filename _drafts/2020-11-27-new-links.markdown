Happy Monday to all. This week we'll be discussing:

- David Fowler on the ASP.NET Core standup
- .NET 6 planning
- Microsoft Q&A for .NET is a thing

## David Fowler's appearance

package into any component, built from the get-go

if you need most packages, what do you do? we have a shared framework (kesterel as a component)

kestrel perf was terrible

code over configuration (web.config) -> had to reconfigure yourself

composition from DI -> separate components via module

functions over classes - vb lambda and f# -> to begin with - MVC got the least changes for the stack. Keep MVC compatible

Pay for MVC even if you don't use it

MVC -> framework for framework authors

Houdini
    Make MVCs disappear -> features are actually in the entire stack. Like routing, Razor in general (s/a in language features, no generic base type)

    Push productivity features into the core of the stack

    Make jump from imperative routing to declarative MVC smaller (improve perf along the way)

kestrel manages sockets for you
kestrel support preview .net 5 http/3

mvc -> super complex state machine

don't need a lot of extension filters

```csharp
[ActionFilter]
public class HomeController : ControllerBase
{
    public string Index() => "Hello Maunal Action.";
}
```

controllers are declarative, get is imperivie

```csharp
app.UseEndpoints(e =>
{
    endpoints.MapHttpHandler<MyHandler>();
    endpoints.MapHttpHandler<ProductsHandler>();

    endpoints.MapAction("/api/products", () =>
    {
        return Enumerable.Empty<Product>();
    });
})
```

generate the code you do for you at compile time

writes to the response pipe, super efficient -> middleware performance with the style of MVC.

What about model binding, you'll ask for it. On my default. Doevetail back into response

compile code into the body

think about razor pages - don't think about implementation. conceptually, vertical app models that sit on top of asp.net core. 

each one of those -> MVC, everything else is more specialized. infra is so much more complicated - APIs, 

you're paying so much - existing API controller (mvc) -> 80%, you can change to a new vertical controller. Didn't change other code for a certain category of an API controller. You get runtime perf and treeshake more effectively when real AOT comes. Not as dynamically composable. Code looks very similar.

MVC will be around forever (like Orchard). If you're building simple APIs - use MVCs for REST and a different CRUD layer.

HTTP part is quite slim, and delegates to something else. Why pay for what MVC can do if you aren't using those things. Framework that builds other frameworks.

Look at speakerdeck for Fowler's talk -> more of the talk and lifecycle for .NET 6 and very little code is being written
