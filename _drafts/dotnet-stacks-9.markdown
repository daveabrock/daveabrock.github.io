## Project Coyote

psharp more than a resource project

async await Task library - if not careful it hides abstractions

maximize throughout minimize costs

test every async test and explore by doing one thing at a time with thread serialization

trying to find a bug in months

kind of like time-travel debeggung but don't have to go back-in-time

This is an `inline` code fence.

```csharp
public void AMethod()
{
    Console.WriteLine("It works!");
}
```
