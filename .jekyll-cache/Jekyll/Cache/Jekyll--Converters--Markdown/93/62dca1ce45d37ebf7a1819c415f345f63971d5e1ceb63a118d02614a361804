I"—<p>So far in our series, weâ€™ve <a href="https://daveabrock.com/2020/10/26/blast-off-blazor-intro">walked through the intro</a>, <a href="https://daveabrock.com/2020/10/28/blast-off-blazor-404-page">wrote our first component</a>, <a href="https://daveabrock.com/2020/11/08/blast-off-blazor-update-head">dynamically updated the HTML head from a component</a>, and <a href="https://daveabrock.com/2020/11/22/blast-off-blazor-service-dependencies">isolated our service dependencies</a>, and worked on <a href="https://daveabrock.com/2020/12/13/blast-off-blazor-cosmos">hosting our images over Azure Blob Storage and Cosmos DB</a>.</p>

<p>Now, weâ€™re going to query Cosmos DB, fetch our images, and display them in an image gallery. Weâ€™ll learn how to reuse components and pass parameters to methods. After we work on this post, weâ€™ll enhance the page in future posts with search</p>
