I"^	<p>So far in our series, we’ve <a href="https://daveabrock.com/2020/10/26/blast-off-blazor-intro">walked through the intro</a>, <a href="https://daveabrock.com/2020/10/28/blast-off-blazor-404-page">wrote our first component</a>, <a href="https://daveabrock.com/2020/11/08/blast-off-blazor-update-head">dynamically updated the HTML head from a component</a>, and <a href="https://daveabrock.com/2020/11/22/blast-off-blazor-service-dependencies">isolated our service dependencies</a>, and worked on <a href="https://daveabrock.com/2020/12/13/blast-off-blazor-cosmos">hosting our images over Azure Blob Storage and Cosmos DB</a>.</p>

<p>Now, we’re going to query Cosmos DB, fetch our images, and display them in an image gallery. We’ll learn how to reuse components and pass parameters to methods.</p>

<p>After we work on this post, we’ll enhance the page in future posts, with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Enabling the “infinite scrolling” feature with Blazor virtualization</li>
  <li>Filter and query images</li>
  <li>Create a dialog to learn more and see the image in a larger size</li>
</ul>

<p>If you haven’t been with us for the whole series, we’re building a Blazor Web Assembly app hosted with Azure Static Web Apps at <em>blastoffwithblazor.com</em>. We’ve copied images from the NASA APOD API (all 25 years!) to Azure Blob Storage, and are storing the image metadata in a serverless Cosmos DB instance. Feel free to read those links to learn more.</p>

<p>With the images in place, we’re going to build this image gallery. It’s responsive and will look good on devices of any size.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000//images/image-gallery.png" alt="Our slow site" /></p>

<p>All code <a href="https://github.com/daveabrock/NASAImageOfDay">is on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>In previous posts, to get up and running we fetched a random image. To make things more interesting, we’re going to fetch images from the last 90 days. (In future posts, we’ll work on infinite scrolling and searching and filtering.) This requires updates to our Azure Function.</p>
