I"¤<p>So far in our series, weâ€™ve <a href="https://daveabrock.com/2020/10/26/blast-off-blazor-intro">walked through the intro</a>, <a href="https://daveabrock.com/2020/10/28/blast-off-blazor-404-page">wrote our first component</a>, <a href="https://daveabrock.com/2020/11/08/blast-off-blazor-update-head">dynamically updated the HTML head from a component</a>, and <a href="https://daveabrock.com/2020/11/22/blast-off-blazor-service-dependencies">isolated our service dependencies</a>, and worked on <a href="https://daveabrock.com/2020/12/13/blast-off-blazor-cosmos">hosting our images over Azure Blob Storage and Cosmos DB</a>.</p>

<h1 id="wrap-up">Wrap up</h1>

<p>In this post, we worked on speeding up the loading of our images. We first moved our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Image</code> component off the home page, then integrated Cosmos DB into our application. Finally, we cleaned up our tests.</p>
