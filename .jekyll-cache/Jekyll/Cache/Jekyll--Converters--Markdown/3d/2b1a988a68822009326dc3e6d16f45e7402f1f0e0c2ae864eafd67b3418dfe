I"ß<p>I was writing some vanilla JavaScript this weekend - it has been quite awhile since I did so. As Iâ€™ve been writing mostly C# code lately, what always gets me with JavaScript isnâ€™t its pain points or subtle nuances. Itâ€™s the different behavior from compiled languages Iâ€™m often used to, like C# or Java. No matter how often I work in JS, as long as Iâ€™m committed to being a polyglot, itâ€™ll trip me up to the point that itâ€™s just a little bit of an annoyance.</p>
