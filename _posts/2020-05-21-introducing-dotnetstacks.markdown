Every Friday or so, I typically round up the week's best links. I wanted to expand on this further, and have a weekly digest of news and perspectives on the .NET world. I've always enjoyed the format of newsletters and have found many of them to be lacking. I think the community can do better.

So, starting on May 25, I'll be launching a weekly newsletter called [The .NET Stacks](https://www.dotnetstacks.com/register). It'll be a round up of the last week in .NET, but also delivered with perspective. This will be replacing my weekly links.

If you're interested, feel free to [register here](https://www.dotnetstacks.com/register). I hope you enjoy it!
