## EF Core 5 is "done"

## Unit testing is dead, long live unit testing

## September is F#-tember at *The .NET Stacks*

Do you work in F#? Or are you a C# developer and intrigued by its possibilities but haven't found time to dive in? As C# has "borrowed" a lot of functional programming paradigms, you might be wondering about tradeoffs between C# "with functional bits" and straight F#. I've got you covered.

Later this month, I'll be interviewing Isaac Abraham, author of *[Get Programming with F#](https://www.manning.com/books/get-programming-with-f-sharp)*, and Phillip Carter, the PM for F# at Microsoft. Stay tuned for some great conversations.
